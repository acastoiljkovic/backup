### Section for remote Targz ###
### NOTE ###
# 1.    In order to execute remote backup, system assume that
#       ssh keys are exchanged with server for root user
#       permissions. Commands that can achieve above are provided below:
#       if you don't have ssh key, it can be generated using next command
#       ssh-keygen
#       to exchange keys with the server use next command :
#       put server IP in place of 192.168.0.15
#       ssh-copy-id root@192.168.0.15
# 2.    Also you will have to create NFS server either on remote server
#       or on local machine or some third machine, and to mount that NFS Share
#       at the same path on each of them.
#       IE. Destination directory '/data/es' is the first in the list and this directory
#       on remote server had to be mounted same as local directory '/data/es'
#       in order to perform encryption tasks and cleanup old files or upload to OneDrive.
#       WARNING: If you don't provide shared storage in any form,
#       backup will still be created, but every single time that system
#       perform backup a new file will be generated. System will log error and proceed to work.
